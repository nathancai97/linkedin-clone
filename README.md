LinkedIn clone created using React, CSS, Redux, firebase. Functional feed where users are able to register an account and leave messages on my profile page.

This is a LinkedIn clone created using React, CSS to apply styles, firebase to authenticate and authorize users in order to allow them to post on the feed. This application includes a sign up page where users can sign up, create their own profile and view others who have left messages on the feed in real time. In the future, I would like to implement the different features LinkedIn offers, like the Network tab to add friends, Jobs, Messaging, and notifications.

The website link is currently down and I am in the process of debugging it on firebase.
